# Whyapp
### **Project Goals**

1. **Build a secure chat application** with authentication and encryption.
2. **Integrate the Gemini API** for AI-powered chat capabilities.
3. Support **chat interactions over various file formats** (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel).
4. Follow **best practices** in design, development, and deployment.

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

### 1. **Define Project Scope**

- List core features (e.g., user authentication, real-time chat, file upload, AI interaction).
- Outline optional features (e.g., user profiles, message storage, typing indicators).

### 2. **Set Up the Environment**

- Choose your tech stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + WebSocket/Socket.IO for real-time communication.
- Ensure you have development tools like Node.js, npm/yarn, VS Code, and a GitHub repo for version control.

### 3. **Build Core Features**

1. **User Authentication**
    - Implement secure login/signup using JWT or OAuth.
    - Add password encryption (e.g., bcrypt).
2. **Real-Time Chat**
    - Use Socket.IO or WebSocket for live message exchange.
    - Focus on scalability (e.g., using Redis for WebSocket session management).
3. **Secure Communication**
    - Add end-to-end encryption for messages.
    - Use HTTPS with secure WebSocket (wss://).

### 4. **Integrate Gemini API**

- Study the Gemini API documentation and get API keys.
- Create a backend service to handle user queries and process responses using Gemini.
- Add functionality for AI to interact with uploaded file content.

### 5. **Handle File Uploads and Parsing**

- Use libraries like `multer` for file uploads.
- Parse file content using libraries such as:
    - PDF: `pdf-lib` or `pdf-parse`
    - Word: `mammoth` or `docxtemplater`
    - Excel: `xlsx`
- Implement a system to convert parsed data into chat-compatible formats.

### 6. **UI/UX Design**

- Build a simple, responsive UI with React and Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.
- Include file upload, chat interface, and a message history view.

### 7. **Testing and Optimization**

- Write unit and integration tests using Jest and testing libraries like React Testing Library.
- Test for scalability and security vulnerabilities.

### 8. **Deploy and Document**

- Deploy the app using platforms like Vercel/Netlify for the frontend and AWS/Heroku for the backend.
- Write a clear README with setup instructions, API references, and feature descriptions.
